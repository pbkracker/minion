About Minion
============

Minion is a security testing framework built by Mozilla to bridge the gap between developers and security testers. To do so, it enables developers to scan their projects using a friendly interface.

About this project
------------------

This repository is an 'umbrella' project that simply ties together the separate projects that Minion needs.

Custom / Forked Projects:

* https://github.com/pbkracker/minion-core
* https://github.com/pbkracker/minion-arachni-plugin

Mozilla Projects

* https://github.com/mozilla/minion-frontend
* https://github.com/mozilla/minion-zap-plugin
* https://github.com/mozilla/minion-garmr-plugin
* https://github.com/mozilla/minion-skipfish-plugin
* https://github.com/mozilla/minion-nmap-plugin

This project contains a script that will check out the above projects. See below in the setup instructions.

Setting up a development environment
------------------------------------

Whatever platform you use, you will need the following tools:

* Python 2.7
* virtualenv
* git
* mysql

If you work on Ubuntu, install the following packages:

    $ sudo apt-get install git build-essential python-virtualenv python-dev mysql-server libmysqlclient-dev
    $ sudo apt-get install nmap skipfish

If you work on Fedora 18, install the following packages:

    $ sudo yum groupinstall 'Development Tools'
    $ sudo yum install mysql mysql-server python-devel python-virtualenv mysql-devel
    $ sudo yum install nmap skipfish
    
You can make Minion ready for development by following these steps:

    $ git clone https://github.com/pbkracker/minion
    $ cd minion
    $ ./setup.sh clone
    $ ./setup.sh develop

Then, setup the frontend by copying the template `local.py-dist` to `local.py`:

    $ cp minion-frontend/project/settings/local.py-dist minion-frontend/project/settings/local.py
    
Next, edit the `local.py` settings file to include the IP address of your machine for `SITE_URL`. If you are running the task-engine or plugin-service on a different port or machine, you will need to edit those settings as well.

Minion requires a MySQL database. By default it uses minion as the database, username and password and expects the database to be running on localhost. You can change these settings in `projects/settings/local.py`.

If you have MySQL running on localhost, you can add a new database and user for Minion as follows:

    mysql -u root
    mysql>CREATE DATABASE minion;
    mysql>CREATE USER 'minion'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'minion';
    mysql>GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES on minion.* to minion@localhost ;
    mysql>exit;

*DO NOT USE THESE SETTINGS FOR PRODUCTION - WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO HARDEN YOUR MYSQL SETUP AND USE A DIFFICULT TO GUESS USERNAME AND PASSWORD*

Minion uses Persona, which means you need to configure the IP address or hostname on which you run Minion. This is done with the `SITE_URL` option in `projects/settings/local.py`. If you forget to set this, you will not be able to login.

Running Minion in Development Mode
----------------------------------

To run Minion you need to have three things up and running:

* The Task Engine
* The Plugin Service
* The Frontend

The order is not important, just start them all up in separate terminal windows. The easiest way to start them in development mode is to use the provided `setup.sh` script.

To start the Task Engine:

    $ cd minion
    $ ./setup.sh run-task-engine
    12-10-31 16:06:53 I Starting task-engine on 127.0.0.1:8282
    2012-10-31 16:06:53-0400 [-] Log opened.
    2012-10-31 16:06:53-0400 [-] Site starting on 8282
    2012-10-31 16:06:53-0400 [-] Starting factory <twisted.web.server.Site instance at 0x10d4e0d88>

To start the Plugin Service:

    $ cd minion
    $ ./setup.sh run-plugin-service
    12-10-31 16:08:52 I Starting plugin-service on 127.0.0.1:8181
    12-10-31 16:08:52 I Registered plugin minion.plugins.basic.HSTSPlugin
    12-10-31 16:08:52 I Registered plugin minion.plugins.basic.XFrameOptionsPlugin
    12-10-31 16:08:52 I Registered plugin minion.plugins.garmr.GarmrPlugin
    12-10-31 16:08:52 I Registered plugin minion.plugins.nmap.NMAPPlugin
    2012-10-31 16:08:52-0400 [-] Log opened.
    2012-10-31 16:08:52-0400 [-] Site starting on 8181
    2012-10-31 16:08:52-0400 [-] Starting factory <twisted.web.server.Site instance at 0x11086f6c8>

Start the frontend in a new shell window:

    $ cd minion
    $ ./setup.sh run-frontend
